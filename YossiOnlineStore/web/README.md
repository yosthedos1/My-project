you must have these files on your computer before installation:
* A copy of JDK/JRE + Netbeans 7.x +
	http://netbeans.org/downloads/
	
* A built in or external container like Apache Tomcat 7.x +
	http://tomcat.apache.org
	
* MySQL Database with the same name as the project, (you can use Xampp)
* take the MySQL File (shop_db.sql) Under jLibs directory of project root, Import the file into your database and you have your tables ready
* Configuring Apache Server along with MySQL will be probably s system like mine for using phpMyAdmin
* Install XAMPP/WAMPP as per the the above two steps if not you will have to install manually
* data base name - shop_db
* user name (in order to log in as an administrator)- yosi0679@gmail.com
* password - 9310679 
	
* Clean the project, Build the project and deploy it into the container
